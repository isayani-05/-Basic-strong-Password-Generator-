###ðŸ§  How It Works
- The script imports character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation) from the string module.

- It combines all these sets into one pool.

- Then, using random.sample, it picks a specified number of characters without repetition to form the password.

[Note: The password length must not exceed the total number of unique characters available in the character pool, or an error will occur.
For most use cases, 8â€“16 characters is a good range.]
